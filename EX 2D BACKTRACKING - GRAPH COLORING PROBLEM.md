# EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking, assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color while minimizing the number of colors used.



## Algorithm

1.Initialize a color list with all vertices uncolored (value 0). 

2.Start coloring vertices recursively, trying each color from 1 to m. 

3.Check if assigning a color is safe by ensuring no adjacent vertex has the same color.

4.Backtrack if a color leads to conflict, and try the next available color.

5.Print the color assignment if all vertices are colored successfully, otherwise state no solution.

# Driver code

g.graph = [
    [0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0]

## Result:
The Graph Coloring program executed successfully, and the colors were assigned to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
